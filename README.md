# Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a web-based application designed to manage inventory-related tasks within a store or mall. It enables administrators to perform various operations such as adding new products, updating product information, deleting products, and viewing product details. The system aims to streamline inventory stock and ordering processes, improving efficiency in managing product data.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: The system ensures that only authorized personnel can access and manage inventory data. Administrators can log in with their credentials to access the system.
  
- **Product CRUD Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Add new products to the inventory.
  - **Read**: View detailed information about products.
  - **Update**: Modify existing product details.
  - **Delete**: Remove products from the inventory.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - **Spring Boot**: Provides the framework for building the backend of the application.
  - **MySQL**: Used as the backend database to store inventory and order-related information such as product and order details.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - **Servlets**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, processing user inputs, interacting with the database, and generating dynamic content.
  - **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Create dynamic web pages that display product data and interact with users, separating presentation logic from business logic.

     spring.datasource.username=your-username
     spring.datasource.password=your-password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     ```

3. **Build the project**:
